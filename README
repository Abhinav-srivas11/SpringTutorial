Hi there reader,


This spring tutorial repo is a culmination of a 2 hour spring boot framework tutorial that I found on YouTube (freecodecamp channel).

Through this tutorial I was able to understand the basics of Spring Boot and how it is structured to develop a working piece of code.

It focuses heavily on separating blocks of code into smaller modules that inevitably are combined together to function as a group.

It taught me the concepts of OOP and how JAVA,SPRING and MAVEN can be combined to create a working application that is ready for a real-life application.

Although 2 hours is not enough to learn all concepts but it definitely helped me to take a dip into the vast knowledged pool and understand how to swim(metaphorically).

I hope to make something on my own soon and shall update my profile with it as soon as it is finished.

Thank you for reading
